    <p><b><u>useReducer()</u> => </b>An alternative to the useState Hook, it helps you manage complex state logic in React applications. When combined with other Hooks like useContext, useReducer can be a good alternative to Redux or MobX â€” indeed, it can sometimes be an outright better option. The useReducer is used to store and update states, just like the useState Hook. It accepts a reducer function as its first parameter and the initial state as the second. useReducer returns an array that holds the current state value and a dispatch function, to which you can pass an action and later invoke. This is similar to the pattern Redux uses but with a few differences.</p>
